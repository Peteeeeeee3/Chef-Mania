# Chef-Mania

Chef Mania is a game I created for a university course work. Two players play against each other with the aim of delivering more meals than the opponent. 
Chefs have different different abilities depending on the score of the opposing player. The game has four different playable maps, each with unique feature s to enhance the
gameplay.

Most, but not all of the art is done by me.
